# TDT 01/16/2019: Current desired spec outline for new LUGOD site.
# 

* TOP/FRONT PAGE MATTER: 
  Upcoming meeting information/time/location should be very near the top, ideally before
  any scrolling has to happen at all. Under a logo image.
 
  The block of text at the top of http://www.lugod.org/ follows next.

  A brief news items list (title or title + 2 sentences, maybe taken from the blogs?) 
  and list of upcoming events on the front page might not be bad, either. A 2-column
  block affair might be nice for that, but better ideas welcome.
 
  Bottom matter should include the 501(c)(7) notice and sunset systems hosting notice as
  is on the current front page.

* NAV/SIDEBAR ESSENTIAL CATEGORIES:
  Top-level categories should be in a navbar or sidebar, with sub-categories
  in an on-hover dropdown type deal. CSS-driven, ideally, not JS.

** Archive: 
   This section is a bit tentative still. "Old Site" should definitely be here, but
   the other stuff is worth debating whether it's worth linking directly. May be worth
   making a new "History" section under the earlier "About" section.
